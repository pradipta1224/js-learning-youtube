if(true){
    let a = 10
const b = 20
var c = 30
} //This basically is the scope, it's not the scope when it's object, that's different, that's object declaration, but when it's functions or nested if else or loops then it's scope



// console.log(a) //An error shows which says a is not defined coz it's inside the braces, inside the scope
// console.log(b) //Same with b, just like a
console.log(c) //But when we comment out a and b console.logs then we can see that the output of c shows up and prints 30 , coz the datatype used here is var and that's the fault of using var, it doesn't obey the laws of block scope or local scope


//Global scope is different in the browser console vs the code envinronment
